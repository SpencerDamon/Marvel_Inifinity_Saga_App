Points that were challenging:
Problem: Adding an Empty Project template to an existing GitHub Repository
Fix: Branched repo; created a new Empty Project from template;
     copied template files to branch with File Explorer, used
     .gitignore as a guide to which files to omit.

Problem: Must Force Push to add branched commits to GitHub repo, problem
         with file endings.
Fix: ???

Problem: Set number of rows for GridLayout in RecyclerView
Fix: In RecyclerView element, add/set attribute app:spanCount="2"

Problem: Failed Progress Loading test point in MainActivity - Error expected object but found
         string instead.
Fix: Studied JSON file again, noticed that each movie was a single object with string attributes,
     unlike Countries app which had child objects and string attributes, for each parent country
     object. Set attribute types to String in MarvelResponse class. Delete unnecessary declared
     class files.

Problem: Had to manually set ConstraintLayout width to 205dp for RecyclerView Row layout.
Fix: Set RecyclerView Row Layout ConstraintLayout to "match_parent"

Problem: Change the text in the ActionBar from "spencerchallenge" to "Marvel Infinity Saga".
Fix: Add supportActionBar?.title = "Marvel Infinity Saga" to MainActivity OnCreate function.

Problem: Movie title TextView with white text was difficult to see on some posters
Fix: Add tint to TextView background.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
    Had to do a lot of playing with padding and margin attributes to get correct look.
    (Need to study Layouts more)
