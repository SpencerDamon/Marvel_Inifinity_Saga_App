Points that were challenging:
Problem: Adding an Empty Project template to an existing GitHub Repository
Fix: Branched repo; created a new Empty Project from template;
     copied template files to branch with File Explorer, used
     .gitignore as a guide to which files to omit.

Problem: Must Force Push to add branched commits to GitHub repo, problem
         with file endings.
Fix: ???

Problem: Set number of rows for GridLayout in RecyclerView
Fix: In RecyclerView element, add/set attribute app:spanCount="2"

Problem: Failed Progress Loading test point in MainActivity - Error expected object but found
         string instead.
Fix: Studied JSON file again, noticed that each movie was a single object with string attributes,
     unlike Countries app which had child objects and string attributes, for each parent country
     object. Set attribute types to String in MarvelResponse class. Delete unnecessary declared
     class files.

Problem: Had to manually set ConstraintLayout width to 205dp for RecyclerView Row layout.
Fix: Set RecyclerView Row Layout ConstraintLayout to "match_parent"

Problem: Change the text in the ActionBar from "spencerchallenge" to "Marvel Infinity Saga".
Fix: Add supportActionBar?.title = "Marvel Infinity Saga" to MainActivity OnCreate function.

Problem: Movie title TextView with white text was difficult to see on some posters
Fix: Add tint to TextView background.

Challenges Stage 2

Problem: Unsure how to create second branch and still get project files
Fix: Merged first branch into new second branch, however creates a conflict with vcs.xml

Problem: Too many text views for a single activity view without a scroll bar
Fix: Implemented a ScrollView as the root view for the Second Activity, nested a constraint layout

Problem: Unable to pass api to second activity
Fix: passed data to second activity as putExtra as individual val of Type String
     received data as getExtra with individual if null safety checks and received individual strings

Problem: Unable to pass image to view element in second activity with Glide
Fix:  Assigned an ID to constraint layout and passed the stored value with intent to the Glide load
      function

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
    Had to do a lot of playing with padding and margin attributes to get correct look.
    (Need to study Layouts more)
